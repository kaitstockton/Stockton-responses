<h1> Clark and Andersen Response </h1> 
<p> In their article, Clark and Andersen (2005) discuss the importance of technical communicators breaking away from the notion of seeing “technology as tools.” The authors write many technical communicators only see themselves as writers who work with the end user and have no say in the design or business processes of a project or document. The idea of “technology as tools” only adds fuel to this issue as technical communicators are only focused on learning these tools and implementing them rather than questioning the business or management problems that arise during projects. </p>
<p> Clark and Andersen specifically mention the importance of XML when they discuss knowledge and content management. According to the authors, XML allows technical communicators to articulate knowledge <q> across different branches of an organization, closely examining [this knowledge], and then [break] it down into its essential components </q> (p. 290). As a result, technical communicators not only have knowledge of this content but also know what information is included in each step of a project. This knowledge allows technical communicators to communicate with managers, business advocates, and IT professionals about different aspects of a project. </p>
<p> While reading the article, I saw fewer mentions of XML compared to the authors’ insistence of technical communicators learning how to interact in business environments and asserting their value. Clark and Andersen discuss how many technical communicators are isolated and have little say in the design process of a project. The authors highlight how this situation negatively affects both sides by providing the example of Andersen's experience at a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. In a course, the programmers and developers on a project cared less about the end user and more about completing a project as soon as they could. The authors use this example to show how a technical communicator would have improved this project if one was allowed to work throughout its varying stages. </p> 

<p> Most of the recommendations included technical communication students take on more business and management courses and learn the business environment of a job before venturing into technical aspects. I feel like the authors quickly mentioned XML, content management, and knowledge management to provide technical communicators with ways to show their value and be included during each stage of a project. </p>
