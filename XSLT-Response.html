<h1>XSLT</h1> 
<p>XSLT, also know as Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, is a language that can transform XML documents into other XML documents and other formats such as HTML and PDFs. XSLT works like a funnel where a person can place XML into it. A parser under the funnel selects what will be funneled to the output document. The information the parser selects is based on the type of output the user wants.  </p>
<h2>XSLT and Technical Communicators</h2> 
<p> Technical communicators can use XML and XSLT to add value to their positions in their companies. So far, we have read many articles questioning the future of technical communications and the technical communicator’s role in many organizations. Many researchers have mentioned how technical communicators are often isolated and have little say in the business or managerial aspects of their companies. However, knowing XML and XSLT allows technical communicators to become more than writers. They become content managers who have more influence and oversight over each step of a project. XML and XSLT allow technical communicators to show employers that they are vital to the company’s success by saving time on projects as well as increasing the efficiency of their work. Technical communicators can write a document in XML and then use XSLT to transform it into different formats. For example, they can transform XML and all its contents into HTML, XHTML, or even PDF files. Rather than make multiple files, technical communicators can create one file of information that can be transformed into others while still retaining the same information. Knowing these languages will only help technical communicators keep their jobs in companies while also expanding their roles. Using these technologies and tools will also allow the field of technical communication to continue growing. </p>
