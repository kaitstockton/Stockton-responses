Progress on Project 2 

I currently have 34 entries for my table. I have to completed most of the table, but still need to add more information for some entries and plan to add a few more video games to the table. I have written the XML, XSLT, and CSS for my project. I have to change some of my XML and XSLT to add lists to my table. I want to continue to work on my CSS to make the table look better. My XML, XSLT, and CSS are all speaking to each other and work together when I run the information in browsers. 

For the rest of the project, I plan to add more entries, fill in current entries, add lists, and add more styles. I hope to try working with Java to see if I can add a search bar and a sorting feature. If I have the time, I hope to try working with more HTML to create navigation bars, links, and more to make it look like a webpage. I am not sure if I will get to this part though. 

How would we complete the html part of the extra credit? 
Is javascript like CSS where it has its own stylesheet, or is it inserted into one of the other files? 
If I want to add things like more html and make a webpage for my table, how would all the different files work together?
