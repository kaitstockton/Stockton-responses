	The scope is limited. 
5.	If the article does not adhere to topic-based characteristics, how would you break the article apart so it does adhere to the principles?

1.	What kind of content is being presented? (conceptual, task based, reference material) 
	The document covers a concept. It describes what is new in Windows 10. However, it does mention one task even though it is not in a numbered or ordered list.  
2.	What specific user question is being answered? 
	The article is answering the questions of "What is new in Windows 10?"
3.	Is there enough context for this to be a topic-based article?  
	The author provides context. The article is broad, so it does not seem like there need to be more context than "see what is new in Windows 10." I also Windows 10, so my past knowledge may keep me from seeing if there needs to be more context. Each section offers context though. 
4.	Is the scope limited enough? 
	The scope is limited. 
5.	If the article does not adhere to topic-based characteristics, how would you break the article apart so it does adhere to the principles?
 	I think the article meets the characteristics of a topic-based article. It is also self-contained and links to further information if people need more information.

1.	What kind of content is being presented? (conceptual, task based, reference material) 
	The document is task based. It offers instructions for different steps. 
2.	What specific user question is being answered? 
	The article is answering the questions of "How to set up or use email on Surface on the mail app or in Outlook"
3.	Is there enough context for this to be a topic-based article?  
	The article offers context and links to information for it to be self-contained, but I think it is just poorly designed. The poor design makes it look like it does not offer enough context. I have trouble following the document. I may also need Surface explained to me. 
4.	Is the scope limited enough? 
	I think Outlook and the mail app may need to be separated. There is just a lot of information, and it keeps switching back and forth between these two. 
5.	If the article does not adhere to topic-based characteristics, how would you break the article apart so it does adhere to the principles?
 	I think the article may need to be separated by Outlook and the mail app. It may be confusing to the readers if they have to keep jumping back and forth.
